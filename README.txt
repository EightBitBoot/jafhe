This is a small side project because I was tired of hex editors not
working like I wanted.

The git commits won't be clean and the code won't be tidied or commented.
I just want something quick and dirty that works the way I expect a hex
editor to work.

It's "Just a Freaking Hex Editor".  Replace "Freaking" with whatever you like.
